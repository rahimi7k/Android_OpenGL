A Library to create 2D and 3D objects within C++ Android Native

**3D/2D Object Creation Android App**
This Android app is designed to facilitate the creation and rendering of both 3D and 2D objects using C++. By leveraging native C++ code, the app provides efficient performance and detailed control over object creation and rendering. The app integrates seamlessly with Android, allowing users to design intricate 3D models, as well as simple 2D shapes, while taking advantage of the power of C++ for fast computations and real-time rendering.

Whether you are building complex 3D models for gaming, simulations, or simple 2D graphics for user interfaces, this app provides the flexibility and performance needed to bring your creative vision to life. The inclusion of native code also ensures a robust and optimized experience across a variety of Android devices.

**Model Loading Capabilities**
The app supports a wide range of 3D model file formats, including .obj, .fbx, .glb, .gltf, and their corresponding .mtl files. These formats allow for complex and detailed models to be imported and rendered within the app. The third-party library Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) is utilized to handle the loading of these files, ensuring compatibility with virtually any 3D model format. This integration allows users to import models from a wide variety of sources and use them seamlessly within the app.
